How to install the pack, put some games and play:
1.	Read all information supplied in https://github.com/ChokoGroup/Choko-Hack-Automatic-Lists .
2.	Download the latest release pack from https://github.com/ChokoGroup/Choko-Hack-Automatic-Lists/releases/latest
3.	Open the downloaded *.zip or *.7z file (with 7-zip, for example) and copy the folder 'CHA Choko Games Lists' to the root of an USB disk.
4.	Create folders inside 'CHA Choko Games Lists/roms' with any name (that name will be used in the Choko Menu).
5.	Copy the ROMs you want to the folders created in the previous step. Remember that the default core is FB Alpha and not all ROMs may run OK.
6.	Eject the USB disk safely and insert it in USB EXT of the CHA. Power on and select the wanted list in the menus. Play!
Note: the pack includes icons for thousands of parent ROMs. If you put some ROMs that are not parent, it will try to use parent's assets. If not found, you'll see an image just saying "Game 01", etc.

Installing (and uninstalling) games into the CHA
- When loading games from USB you will also have an option in the Choko Menu to (un)install games into the CHA.
- You must first expand the CHA ext4 partition to use all available space in eMMC or, even better, use a SD card ( https://cha-choko-mod.fandom.com/wiki/SD_Card_reader_MOD ).
- The script starts showing lists of installed games, one by one, asking if we want to uninstall (delete from the CHA's internal memory). Default answer is 'No'.
- Last it will show, one by one, the available lists of games to install. If a list with exactly the same name exists in the CHA a warning is shown about the list already installed being uninstalled before the new is installed in case 'Yes' is selected.
- The script ends showing the remaining free space before rebooting the CHA.
