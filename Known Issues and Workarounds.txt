### Known Issues ###

- Vertical games are sideways, they won't rotate.

- If the list has too many games, bezels or other assets, they may not load, and games will crash frequently.

- Sometimes the "Insert coin" won't work (usually after playing several different games), but rebooting the CHA will fix.

If you are having issues with a game, test the latest fbneo core from https://github.com/ChokoGroup/FBNeo/releases/tag/libretro-latest
(use Core Manager from Choko Menu to download and select.)


### Workarounds ###

- "Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow Over Mystara": 
Player 2 can't select and use weapons/magic. Use fbneo core extracted from Lakka.
