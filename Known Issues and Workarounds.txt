### Known Issues ###

- Vertical games are sideways, they won't rotate.

- If the list has too many games, bezels or buttons options may not load, and games crash frequently.

- Sometimes the "Insert coin" won't work (usually after playing several different games), but rebooting the CHA will fix.



### Workarounds ###

- "Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow Over Mystara": 
Player 2 can't select and use weapons/magic. Use fbneo core extracted from Lakka.

- Comix Zone (megadriv)
- Red Earth
Dragon's Lair (megadriv) doesn't load... but AFTER calling Drangon's Lair once, we can play "Comix Zone" and "Red Earth" by selecting 'restart' in the 'Insert + Start' menu.

- Ghosts'n Goblins
The parent rom (gng.zip) doesn't allow to continue game. Use the US rom instead (gngt.zip).
