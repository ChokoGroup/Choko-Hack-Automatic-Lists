### Known Issues ###

- Vertical games are sideways, they won't rotate.

- If the list has too many games, bezels or buttons options may not load, and games crash frequently.

- Sometimes the "Insert coin" won't work (usually after playing several different games), but rebooting the CHA will fix.

If you are having issues with a game, test the latest fbneo core from https://github.com/ChokoGroup/FBNeo/releases/tag/libretro-latest
(rename it `fba_libretro.so` and put it in `patches/default` or in `patches/SUBFOLDER_WITH_SAME_NAME_AS_ROMS_FOLDER`)


### Workarounds ###

- "Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow Over Mystara": 
Player 2 can't select and use weapons/magic. Use fbneo core extracted from Lakka.
