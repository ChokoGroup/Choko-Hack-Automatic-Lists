## What's new in v12.3.1
- If a folder with the name of the folder with ROMs is not found inside 'patches' but there is a 'default' folder, assets and core inside 'default' will be used.
- Improved the way files inside 'patches' are applied when customizing UI, now all files inside matching folder (or 'default') are recursively mounted.
- Fixed a bug when installing games in CHA and some UI sounds and icons would be missing.
- Added new styles of games images and some audio files.

## What's new in v12.3.0
- Fixed a bug installing and deleting games into the CHA when using roms other than "parents".
Note that version number is only a reference to current Choko Hack version (and recommended).

## What's new in v12.0.0
- Updated to work with Choko Hack v12, that allows navigation with joystick and any folder names under `roms/` and automatically creates menu items for them.
- Automatically creates lists based in content of roms/ subfolders.

- Support for clones roms (tries to find parent rom's assets).
- Updated the games installer/uninstaller. Easily install games lists into the CHA (you should expand the partition to make space for the roms - better yet, add a SD card reader: https://cha-choko-mod.fandom.com/wiki/SD_Card_reader_MOD ).
